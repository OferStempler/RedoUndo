Part 1 – home ex

1.       Undo redo
Objective:

Write a simplistic “word” api capable of performing the following operations
API methods to implement:

Add(String stringToAdd, int position)

Remove (int fromPos, int toPos)

Bold (int fromPos, int toPos)

Italic (int fromPos, int toPos)

Underline (int fromPos, int toPos)

Undo()

Redo()

Print() – this prints current text into the console

This is not about a GUI application, “word” api should be run through java
main, something like this:

main{

                add(“ben”);

                add(“222”);

                bold(0,2); - this will mark position 0,1,2 as bold

                undo() – this will unto the last operation

undo() – this will unto the last operation

redo() – this will revert the last undo

print() – will print ben222


2.     2nd question – phone calls

Assume a file with all the phone calls in the last year from miliseond 0 to
the end of the year



What we want to do is find the time in the year from ms X to
ms Y where we had the highest amount of open calls
 
 
Example for input (phone calls)
0-1
0-4
1-9
1-12
…
700G
 
 
Find the busiest time in the network
 
find a simple solution
 
do not scan the file twice
 
you are limited to 8GB heap
 
3 – research
 
Cassandra vs mongo – research the difference – try to install both and research hands on – be able to answer the following
        What is Consistent hashing
        What is Quorum
        Cassandra is written in java, any affect / issue with GC
        What is best for write performance
        What is best for read performance
        What is best for cross region replication and data consistency
